# UI-Design-Ratatouille

Before running 'npm start' make sure to run:
1. 'npm add react-router-dom" for ability to route to different pages from nav bar
2. 'npm install --save react-helmet'
3. cd into folder called ratatouille
4. run 'npm install'
5. run 'npm start'

Note: works best on full-screen mode

Happy cookin' :)
